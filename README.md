# Notes
A Django Notes App
I have created a Django Notes web app where user can create his everyday Notes, update it, delete it, see his Notes.
To Setup:
  Create a virtual python enviornment
  Goto the folder with the file "manage.py" and enter the following commands
  "python manage.py makemigrations"
  "python manage.py migrate"
  "python manage.py runserver"
  If all the steps are successful, You can rin the file at address:
  localhost:8000/todo/
